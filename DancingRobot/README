Description:
This project is written in JavaScript and HTML and will display a dancing 
robot with WSUV written on its chest in a web browser. A very important part 
in creating my dancing robot was to make sure that the instancing and 
hierarchical modeling was done correctly. I was able to achieve this by
drawing out my robot and taking note of what body parts I wanted to be 
affected by the rotations, translations, and scales I implemented.
