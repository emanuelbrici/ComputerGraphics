Description:
This project is written in JavaScript and will triangulate a simple polygon.
In order to fill polygons in OpenGL, they first need to be decomposed into 
convex polygons. These compositions will normally consist of quadrilaterals 
and/or triangles.  

Example: 
node is required to run this JavaScript program. The input is expected to be of JSON 
format. 

$node PolygonTriangulate.js < star.json > results.json

After the above command is entered into the terminal, the contents of results.json can 
be copied and pasted to https://ezekiel.encs.vancouver.wsu.edu/~cs442/projects/tri/viz/drawpoly.html
to see the results of the polygon that has been created.
