Description:
This project is written in JavaScript and HTML and will display a circular  
shaded tube in a web browser. I was able to come to a solution by first drawing out
the spine and mesh of the circular tube. I used the functions that were described in
part 2 and 3 of the documentation. The spine and mesh implementations are commented out in
the tube.html file. After completing the spine and mesh I then worked on drawing the color
and shade of the circular tube. To add color and shade, only the tube.html file needed
to be modified. The vertex shader is where I added the color, shading and light components
of the tube.
